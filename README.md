# Airline-Passenger-Referral
<br>
<br>
The project aims to predict whether a passenger referred by an existing customer will book a flight or not, based on various features such as seat comfort, cabin service, travel class,food beverage , entertainment service, etc.<br>
The prediction model is developed using classification techniques in machine learning.<br>
The model can be used by airlines to target marketing campaigns towards potential passengers who are likely to book a flight based on a referral from an existing customer.
